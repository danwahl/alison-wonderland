== Bob's Evidence

"Here!" cried Bob, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large he had grown in the last few minutes, and he jumped up in such a hurry that he tipped over the jury-box with the edge of his coat, upsetting all the jurymen onto the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding him very much of a globe of goldfish he had accidentally upset the week before.

"Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!" he exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as he could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in his head, and he had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.

"The trial cannot proceed," said the King in a very grave voice, "until all the jurymen are back in their proper places—_all_," he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Bob as he said so.

Bob looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in his haste, he had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. He soon got it out again, and put it right; "not that it signifies much," he said to himself; "I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the trial one way up as the other."

As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.

"What do you know about this business?" the King said to Bob.

"Nothing," said Bob.

"Nothing _whatever?_" persisted the King.

"Nothing whatever," said Bob.

"That's very important," the King said, turning to the jury. They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: "__Un__important, your Majesty means, of course," he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.

"__Un__important, of course, I meant," the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone,

"important—unimportant—unimportant—important—" as if he were trying which word sounded best.

Some of the jury wrote it down "important," and some "unimportant." Bob could see this, as he was near enough to look over their slates; "but it doesn't matter a bit," he thought to himself.

At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book, cackled out "Silence!" and read out from his book, "Rule Forty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_."

Everybody looked at Bob.

"_I'm_ not a mile high," said Bob.

"You are," said the King.

"Nearly two miles high," added the Queen.

"Well, I shan't go, at any rate," said Bob: "besides, that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now."

"It's the oldest rule in the book," said the King.

"Then it ought to be Number One," said Bob.

The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. "Consider your verdict," he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.

"There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty," said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; "this paper has just been picked up."

"What's in it?" said the Queen.

"I haven't opened it yet," said the White Rabbit, "but it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody."

"It must have been that," said the King, "unless it was written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know."

"Who is it directed to?" said one of the jurymen.

"It isn't directed at all," said the White Rabbit; "in fact, there's nothing written on the _outside_." He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added "It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses."

"Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?" asked another of the jurymen.

"No, they're not," said the White Rabbit, "and that's the queerest thing about it." (The jury all looked puzzled.)

"He must have imitated somebody else's hand," said the King. (The jury all brightened up again.)

"Please your Majesty," said the Knave, "I didn't write it, and they can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end."

"If you didn't sign it," said the King, "that only makes the matter worse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your name like an honest man."

There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day.

"That _proves_ his guilt," said the Queen.

"It proves nothing of the sort!" said Bob. "Why, you don't even know what they're about!"

"Read them," said the King.

The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. "Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?" he asked.

"Begin at the beginning," the King said gravely, "and go on till you come to the end: then stop."

These were the verses the White Rabbit read:—

....
"They told me you had been to her,
    And mentioned me to him:
She gave me a good character,
    But said I could not swim.

He sent them word I had not gone
    (We know it to be true):
If she should push the matter on,
    What would become of you?

I gave her one, they gave him two,
    You gave us three or more;
They all returned from him to you,
    Though they were mine before.

If I or she should chance to be
    Involved in this affair,
He trusts to you to set them free,
    Exactly as we were.

My notion was that you had been
    (Before she had this fit)
An obstacle that came between
    Him, and ourselves, and it.

Don't let him know she liked them best,
    For this must ever be
A secret, kept from all the rest,
    Between yourself and me."
....

"That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet," said the King, rubbing his hands; "so now let the jury—"

"If any one of them can explain it," said Bob, (he had grown so large in the last few minutes that he wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting him,) "I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it."

The jury all wrote down on their slates, "_He_ doesn't believe there's an atom of meaning in it," but none of them attempted to explain the paper.

"If there's no meaning in it," said the King, "that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't know," he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; "I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. "—_said I could not swim_—" you can't swim, can you?" he added, turning to the Knave.

The Knave shook his head sadly. "Do I look like it?" he said. (Which he certainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)

"All right, so far," said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself: "'_We know it to be true_—' that's the jury, of course—'_I gave her one, they gave him two_—' why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know—"

"But, it goes on '_they all returned from him to you_,'" said Bob.

"Why, there they are!" said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table. "Nothing can be clearer than _that_. Then again—'_before she had this fit_—' you never had fits, my dear, I think?" he said to the Queen.

"Never!" said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)

"Then the words don't _fit_ you," said the King, looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.

"It's a pun!" the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, "Let the jury consider their verdict," the King said, for about the twentieth time that day.

"No, no!" said the Queen. "Sentence first—verdict afterwards."

"Stuff and nonsense!" said Bob loudly. "The idea of having the sentence first!"

"Hold your tongue!" said the Queen, turning purple.

"I won't!" said Bob.

"Off with his head!" the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved.

"Who cares for you?" said Bob, (he had grown to his full size by this time.) "You're nothing but a pack of cards!"

At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon him: he gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found himself lying on the bank, with his head in the lap of his sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon his face.

image::images/42.jpg["You're nothing but a pack of cards!", align=center]

"Wake up, Bob dear!" said his sister; "Why, what a long sleep you've had!"

"Oh, I've had such a curious dream!" said Bob, and he told his sister, as well as he could remember them, all these strange Adventures of his that you have just been reading about; and when he had finished, his sister kissed him, and said, "It _was_ a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late." So Bob got up and ran off, thinking while he ran, as well he might, what a wonderful dream it had been.

'''

But his sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Bob and all his wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:—

First, she dreamed of little Bob himself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of his voice, and see that queer little toss of his head to keep back the wandering hair that _would_ always get into his eyes—and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little brother's dream.

The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.

So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs.

Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little brother of hers would, in the after-time, be himself a grown man; and how he would keep, through all his riper years, the simple and loving heart of his childhood: and how he would gather about him other little children, and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how he would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering his own child-life, and the happy summer days.

THE END.
